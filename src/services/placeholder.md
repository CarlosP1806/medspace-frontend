# Services Folder

This folder contains service files that handle API calls, business logic, or interactions with external systems.

## Purpose

Services are responsible for:

- Fetching data from APIs.
- Sending data to APIs.
- Managing business logic that doesn't belong in components or hooks.

## Examples

- **userService.ts**: Handles user-related API calls, such as fetching user profiles or updating user settings.
- **authService.ts**: Manages authentication logic, such as login, logout, and token refresh.
- **productService.ts**: Fetches product data, manages product creation, and updates product details.

## Example Code

Hereâ€™s an example of a service file (`authService.ts`):

```typescript
// filepath: src/services/authService.ts
import axios from "axios";

const API_URL = "https://api.example.com/auth";

export const login = async (email: string, password: string) => {
  const response = await axios.post(`${API_URL}/login`, { email, password });
  return response.data;
};

export const logout = async () => {
  await axios.post(`${API_URL}/logout`);
};

export const getCurrentUser = async () => {
  const response = await axios.get(`${API_URL}/me`);
  return response.data;
};
```
